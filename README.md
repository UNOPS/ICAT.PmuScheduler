# TraCAD - PMU Scheduler

Backend service for ICAT Climate Action Assessment Tool for Transport Sector - TraCAD.

Supported by [Initiative for Climate Action Transparency - ICAT](https://climateactiontransparency.org/).

Built using [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v18.x/docs/api/) and [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework.

## Google Cloud Installation with Docker
> This is an example cloud installation using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and Google Cloud Plataform. The provided `Dockerfile` can be used for local or cloud installation with different services.

1. In GCP Console, go to [Artifact Registry](https://console.cloud.google.com/artifacts) and enable the Artifact Registry API

2. In the Artifact Registry, create a new repository:
   * **Format:** Docker
   * **Type:** Standard
   * **Location:** desired application location
   * **Encryption:** Google-managed key

3. Download and install [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

4. Download or clone this repository.

5. In the terminal, go to this repository's main folder.

6. Build your container in the Artifacts Register using the provided `Dockerfile`. Usually, the container path is composed of `location/project/repository_created/image_name`

```bash
$ gcloud builds submit --tag [CONTAINER PATH]
```

7. Go to [Cloud Run](https://console.cloud.google.com/run) and create a New Service:
   * Choose the option `Deploy one revision from an existing container image` and select the container image updated in Step 6
   * Add a service name
   * Select the application region
   * Select `Allow unauthenticated invocations` in the Authentication option
   * In the **Container section**:
       * Select Container port 8080
       * Add the Environment Variables
       * Add the Cloud SQL connections

> Noticed that some [special permissions in GCP](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/reference/iam/roles#additional-configuration) can be necessary to perform these tasks.
